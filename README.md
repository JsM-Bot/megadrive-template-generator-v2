# Please add your service account info, so that the bot can get size and name of the file/folder. 
## The bot will work if you do not add it, but still it is recommended to do so, as it may timeout, because the sizechecking api is hosted on repl.it
## Apart from that, if you use the bot which is already hosted by me, see below, it will not timeout, as it uses my service account info.
